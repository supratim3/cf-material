It was designed for an application where there are hundreds of elements that may show a context menu - so intialization speed and memory usage are kept fairly small. It also allows to register context menus without providing actual markup, as $.contextMenu generates DOMElements as needed.\n\n[features](http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/index.html) - \n[demo](http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html) - \n[documentation](http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html)\n\n\n## Dependencies ##\n\n* jQuery 1.7 (using new .on().off() event API)\n* jQuery UI position (optional but recommended)\n\n## Usage ##\n\nregister contextMenu from javascript:\n\n```javascript\n$.contextMenu({\n    // define which elements trigger this menu\n    selector: \".with-cool-menu\",\n    // define the elements of the menu\n    items: {\n        foo: {name: \"Foo\", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(\"Foo!\"); }},\n        bar: {name: \"Bar\", callback: function(key, opt){ alert(\"Bar!\") }}\n    }\n    // there's more, have a look at the demos and docs...\n});\n```\n\nhave a look at the [demos](http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html).\n\n\n## HTML5 Compatibility ##\n\nFirefox 8 implemented contextmenu using the &lt;menuitem&gt; tags for menu-structure. The specs however state that &lt;command&gt; tags should be used for this purpose. $.contextMenu accepts both.\n\nFirefox 8 does not yet fully implement the contextmenu specification ([Ticket #617528](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=617528)). The elements\n[a](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-a-element-to-define-a-command),\n[button](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-button-element-to-define-a-command),\n[input](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-input-element-to-define-a-command) and\n[option](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#using-the-option-element-to-define-a-command) \nusable as commands are being ignored altogether. It also doesn't (optically) distinguish between checkbox/radio and regular commands ([Bug #705292](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=705292)).\n\n* [contextmenu specs](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/interactive-elements.html#context-menus)\n* [command specs](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html)\n* [Browser support according to caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=context%20menu)\n\nNote: While the specs note &lt;option&gt;s to be renderd as regular commands, $.contextMenu will render an actual &lt;select&gt;. import contextMenu from HTML5 &lt;menu&gt;:\n\n```javascript\n$.contextMenu(\"html5\");\n```\n\n## Interaction Principles ##\n\nYou're (obviously) able to use the context menu with your mouse. Once it is opened, you can also use the keyboard to (fully) navigate it.\n\n* ↑ (up) previous item in list, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ↓ (down) next item in, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* → (right) dive into sub-menu\n* ← (left) rise from sub-menu\n* ↵ (return) invoke command\n* ⇥ (tab) next item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ⇪ ⇥ (shift tab) previous item or input element, will skip disabled elements and wrap around\n* ⎋ (escape) close menu\n* ⌴ (space) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ⇞ (page up) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ⇟ (page down) captured and ignore to avoid page scrolling (for consistency with native menus)\n* ↖ (home) first item in list, will skip disabled elements\n* ↘ (end) last item in list, will skip disabled elements\n\nBesides the obvious, browser also react to alphanumeric key strokes. Hitting <code>r</code> in a context menu will make Firefox (8) reload the page immediately. Chrome selects the option to see infos on the page, Safari selects the option to print the document. Awesome, right? Until trying the same on Windows I did not realize that the browsers were using the access-key for this. I would've preferred typing the first character of something, say \"s\" for \"save\" and then iterate through all the commands beginning with s. But that's me - what do I know about UX? Anyways, $.contextMenu now also supports accesskey handling.\n\n\n## Minify ##\n\nuse [Google Closure Compiler](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home):\n\n```\n// ==ClosureCompiler==\n// @compilation_level SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS\n// @output_file_name contextMenu.js\n// @code_url http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/jquery-1.8.2.min.js\n// @code_url http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/src/jquery.ui.position.js\n// @code_url http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/src/jquery.contextMenu.js\n// ==/ClosureCompiler==    \n```\n\n\n## Authors ##\n\n* [Rodney Rehm](https://github.com/rodneyrehm)\n* [Christiaan Baartse](https://github.com/christiaan) (single callback per menu)\n* [Addy Osmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) (compatibility with native context menu in Firefox 8)\n\n\n## License ##\n\n$.contextMenu is published under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license) and [GPL v3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0).\n\n\n## Changelog ##\n\n### 1.6.5 (January 20th 2013) ###\n\n* fixing \"opening a second menu can break the layer\" - ([Issue #105](https://github.com/medialize/jQuery-contextMenu/issues/105))\n\n### 1.6.4 (January 19th 2013) ###\n\n* fixing [jQuery plugin manifest](https://github.com/medialize/jQuery-contextMenu/commit/413b1ecaba0aeb4e50f97cee35f7c367435e7830#commitcomment-2465216), again. yep.
