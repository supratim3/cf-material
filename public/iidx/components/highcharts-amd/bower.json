We strive to keep this a clean, maintainable and searchable record of our open and closed bugs, therefore we kindly ask you to obey some rules before reporting an issue:\n\n1. Make sure the report is accompanied by a reproducible demo. The ideal demo is created by forking [our standard jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/llexl/), adding your own code and stripping it down to an absolute minimum needed to demonstrate the bug.\n* Always add information on what browser it applies to, and other information needed for us to debug.\n* It may be that the bug is already fixed. Try your chart with our latest work from http://github.highcharts.com/master/highcharts.js before reporting.\n* For feature requests, tech support and general discussion, don't use GitHub Issues. See [www.highcharts.com/support](www.highcharts.com/support) for the appropriate channels.",
